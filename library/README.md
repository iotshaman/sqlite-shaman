## Sqlite Shaman - by IoT Shaman

## Access sqlite databases using a simple, familiar ORM syntax.
Let's be honest, the official sqlite3 npm package leaves a lot to be desired. While it is a solid library that works as advertised, it requires users to submit queries in string form, sacrificing discoverability for the sake of simplicity. To compensate for this, many different ORM packages have been developed, with the intent to make sqlite database management simpler. Unfortunately, almost all of there ORMS are extremely bulky, and often opinionated, forcing users to decide between writing hard-coded string queries, or using a bulky ORM. 

The purpose of mysql-shaman is to provide a standardized ORM interface on top of the core sqlite3 package, without adding any additional bulkiness. Now, insteading of writing hard-coded string queries, you can write your CRUD operations using javascript expressions. This significantly improves the developer experience, allowing users to leverage IDE technology to anaylze their data-access operations.

## Requirements
